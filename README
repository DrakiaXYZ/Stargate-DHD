 Description
=============
This is an addon plugin for Stargate that gives the ability to create remote DHD dialing devices.

=============
Known Issues
=============
 - DHD destination does not reset when the gate deactivates.
 
=============
 Permissions
=============
 - stargate.dhd.use - Whether the player can use DHD devices.
 - stargate.dhd.create - Whether the player can create DHD devices. If not, "::DHD::" will be replaced with "NOTaDHD".
 - stargate.dhd.destroy - Whether the player can destroy DHD devices.

=============
Instructions
=============
To create a DHD you simple create a sign with the following layout:
Line1: ::DHD::
Line2: StargateName
Line3: NetworkName (Optional, will default to your Stargate default network if not given)

Where "StargateName" and "NetworkName" are the remote gates name and network.
If the network is not given, it will default to the Stargate plugins default network.

To use the DHD, you right-click on it to select the destination (The current destination will be shown on line 4, as well as
on the Stargate itself). Once you have your destination chosen, left-click the sign to activate the portal.
The DHD does the appropriate permissions, and iConomy (if enabled) checks to make sure the player activating the portal has the
permissions to do so.
An added feature of the DHD is that the activating user is not the only person who can walk through the gate, anybody can use the
gate once it is active. This allows an admin to open a hidden gate for a user to access an area they normally wouldn't be able to.
